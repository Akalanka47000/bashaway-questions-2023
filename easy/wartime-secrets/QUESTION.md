# Wartime Secrets

Amidst the backdrop of colonial India, a brilliant mathematician was on a secret mission to decode enemy messages during World War II. He had to design a password system to secure critical information. Assume you are that mathematician and your challenge here is to create a Bash script that can determine if a password is as strong as the cryptographic defenses of that time. Can your code match the strength of those wartime secrets?

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single **true** or **false** to the console if the password is strong enough or not. A password is considered strong enough if it meets all of the following conditions:
  - It contains at least 1 lowercase alphabetical character
  - It contains at least 1 uppercase alphabetical character
  - It contains at least 1 numeric character
  - It is at least 8 characters long
