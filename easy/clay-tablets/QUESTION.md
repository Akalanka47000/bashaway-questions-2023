# Clay Tablets

In the heart of ancient Mesopotamia, the scribes of the great city of Ur kept records of their civilization's history on clay tablets. Each tablet contained valuable information written on multiple lines. You are to create a Bash script that can elegantly transform the multiline records in one of these tablets into a single line, separated by commas, just as those scribes condensed their knowledge onto clay. Can your code bring the efficiency of the past into the present day?

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.
- The script must be **less than 40 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single line to the console, containing the contents of the **input.txt** file found within the src directory, with each line separated by a comma.
