# System Insight

Once upon a time, a brave coder embarked on a quest to uncover the secrets of a mysterious machine. Armed with their trusty terminal, they delved into the heart of the system, determined to reveal its hidden treasures.

With the incantation of commands and the wave of their keyboard, the coder summoned the CPU's true name, whispered by the spirits of technology. They counted the cores, like counting stars in the night sky, and measured the memory, capturing its essence in bytes.

As the final piece of the puzzle, they unearthed the machine's true identity, its hostname, a secret name known only to the machine itself.

In the end, the brave coder triumphed, presenting their findings in a magical JSON scroll that revealed the machine's secrets to the world:

```json
{
  "cpu": "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz",
  "cores": 12,
  "memory": "47.9 GB",
  "hostname": "DESKTOP-FMO5HV6"
}
```

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

- The script must be **less than 300 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The above JSON must be printed to the console with accurate values.
