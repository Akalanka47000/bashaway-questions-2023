# Cosmic Strings

In the distant realms of the Intergalactic Code Consortium, an ancient script was discovered. It was said to possess the power to decipher the harmony of cosmic strings. A cosmic traveler, seeking to unravel the secrets of this cryptic language, devised a mechanism that could discern whether two strings were palindromes or not. Thus, in the vast expanse of the universe, a Bash script was born to bridge the gaps between distant worlds.

## Example Invocation

```bash
bash execute.sh "racecar" 
```

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

- The script must be **less than 45 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single **1 or 0** must be printed to the console if the input string is a palindrome or not, respectively.
