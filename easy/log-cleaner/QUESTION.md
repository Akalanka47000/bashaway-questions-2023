# Log cleaner

Craft a script that, based on the file's language, purges all unwanted echoes from the codebase. Silence the chatter of **console.log in JavaScript**, hush the **print incantations in Python and Dart**, banish the **System.out.println cries in Java** and extinguish the **Console.WriteLine whispers in C#** restoring harmony to the code. The tarnished files can be found in the **src** directory.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The cleaned files should be inside a directory called **out**
