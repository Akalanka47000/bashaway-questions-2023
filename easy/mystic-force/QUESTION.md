# Mystic Force

In the ancient days of stone tools and cave dwellers, imagine a world where knowledge was etched onto primitive slabs of rock. Now, picture a mystical stone tablet named **a.txt** that held the secrets of the tribe. To ensure the tribe's wisdom was preserved, a shaman duplicated this tablet into **b.txt.** Here's the catch: **whenever a tribal elder inscribed new knowledge onto "a.txt" using their crude markings, the same mystic force engraved those changes onto "b.txt" as well**, as if guided by the spirits of the ancients. Now, in the digital age, we seek to replicate this ancient magic with modern files - creating a.txt and b.txt, linked in such a way that any change to a.txt is mirrored in b.txt, just like the mystical connection of those ancient stone tablets.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

- The script must be **less than 30 characters** in length. (Including spaces, newlines, and the shebang line)

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A copy of a.txt named b.txt created in the same directory as a.txt (src) and linked to it in such a way that any change to a.txt is mirrored in b.txt.
