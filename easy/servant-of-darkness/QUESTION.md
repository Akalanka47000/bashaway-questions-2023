# Servant of Darkness

Far far away within the caverns of the Soulforge, a demon has been summoned. This demon is quite powerful as it is hungry. You as its herald is tasked with feeding it with the souls of the innocent. The demon is quite picky and will only accept souls that are stored within the Azure Realm which unfortunately is millions of light years away. You must find a way to feed the demon with the souls of the innocent by emulating the existence of Azure within the Soulforge.
