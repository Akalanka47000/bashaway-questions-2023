# Spellbound

In a realm where code and sorcery intertwined, an enigmatic coder faced a task reminiscent of a witcher's quest. **Within the src directory lay a cryptic JSON grimoire, filled with objects bearing unpredictable keys and values**. His mission was to **reveal the object where the key "name" held the elusive word "bashaway."** With a spellbound script, he ventured through the arcane data, and like a seasoned witcher, he tracked down the object and its position.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- The array index of the object where the key "name" holds the value "bashaway" must be printed to the console.

- The script should not crash if the src directory is empty or does not exist.
