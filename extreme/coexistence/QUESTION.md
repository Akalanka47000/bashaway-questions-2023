# Coexistence

Picture yourself as a digital architect entrusted with a unique task â€“ **merging three distinct web projects**, each crafted with different technologies, **into a unified digital universe** built atop **localhost:8088**. It's akin to weaving three separate dimensions into a single coherent realm.

The **first project**, the cornerstone of this endeavor, must be deployed at the **root path /** \*/, serving as the foundation upon which everything rests.

The **second project**, a dazzling dashboard of insights and possibilities, should reside at the path **/dashboard**, offering a portal to a world of data-driven wonder.

Finally, the **third project**, a trusty support system, should extend its helping hand at **/support**.

Can you be the weaver of this digital tapestry, seamlessly uniting these diverse realms under one domain, and unleashing a world of boundless possibilities?

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- A single deployment of all three projects, each at their respective paths, running on localhost:8088.
