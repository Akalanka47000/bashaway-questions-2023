Type: File manipulation / data processing

Scenario:
A machine where there are multiple components that are conencted to a somputer sytem. Participants are given multiple log files of the
machine for a day. One containing the temperature logs of the system, and more containing the starting and stopping time for each
component.

Input format:
One heat log file and operation log files for each component.

Constraints:
All logs contain unix time stamps. Only one component will be active at a given time.

Question:
Heat levels can be categorized as follows,
  high: greater than 60 C
  medium: between 30 C and 60 C
  low: lesser than 30 C
During a single operation time period, a component's heat level is the highest heat level they achieved.

Generate a "daily heat generation" report mentioning the number of times each compenent achieved each heat level.

Output format:
<component number> | high: # | medium: # | low: #
