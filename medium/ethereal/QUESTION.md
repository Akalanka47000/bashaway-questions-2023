# Ethereal

Embark on an epic odyssey in the mystical kingdom of Cybersylvan, where a fabled **command of labyrinthine complexity, known as the etherealbinarybeast** has confounded even the wisest of sages. This formidable incantation, a sentence of code that stretched as far as the horizon, was whispered only by the boldest of coders.

Your valorous quest, noble scriptsmith, is to traverse the digital realms and **craft a celestial shortcut**, a command to rule them all, one that shall beckon the Invocation with but a humble utterance. This enchanted shortcut shall henceforth be celebrated as **ethereal**

Prepare thyself to unlock the deepest arcane secrets of the command-line arts, for you are the chosen one. Your journey shall be nothing short of legendary, casting a shimmering light across the tapestry of Cybersylvan!

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- Invoking the command **ethereal** should invoke the command **etherealbinarybeast**.

- The command **etherealbinarybeast** will only be established once the tests are executed. You need to handle the case where the command does not exist and the script should not crash if executed without the command being established.
