# Database Cleaner

In the vast landscape of MongoDB's data kingdom named **bashaway-2k23-cluttered**, your noble quest beckonsâ€”a quest to wield the script of purification. As the guardian of order, your solemn charge is clear: to sweep away the clutter and restore serenity to this digital realm. Let all collections bow before your script, save for the revered "settings" collection, which shall remain untouched, a beacon of knowledge amidst the cleansing tide. Thus, you, the script-weaver, shall bring balance to MongoDB's sprawling dominion.

## Constraints

- The script should be purely written in bash within the **execute.sh** file without using any other programming language

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- No collections except **settings** should be present in the database after the script is executed.
