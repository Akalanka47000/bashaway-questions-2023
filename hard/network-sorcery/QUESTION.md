# Nework Sorcery

To you who's dabbling in the art of network sorcery, a noble task awaitsâ€”a task to conjure the illusion of a mystical https://api.jokes.bashaway.sliitfoss.org domain, a domain that dwells only in the imagination. With a masterful script yet to be revealed, you shall weave a web of redirection, sending all seekers to a local sanctuary, a server dwelling upon port 3000. Thus, you, the script-weaver, shall bring balance to the network.

## Constraints

- The script must be **purely written in bash within the execute.sh file**.

## Output / Evaluation Criteria

- All requests to https://api.jokes.bashaway.sliitfoss.org must hit http://localhost:3000
